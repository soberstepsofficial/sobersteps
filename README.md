# SoberSteps

Welcome to SoberSteps! This branch (main) is considered to be the frontend. There is another branch called 'backend' which holds all backend code (not part of the main deployment, but is crucial if this project wants to be expanded upon.) This repository is a Vite + React single-page app styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Key Details

- Framework: React (v19)
- Dev server & build: Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + PostCSS
- Router: react-router-dom
- Icons: lucide-react
